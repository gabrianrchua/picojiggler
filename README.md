# picojiggler

Simple mouse jigglers for Raspberry Pi Pico family of products using CircuitPython.

Tested using CircuitPython 7.3.0 on Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython 8.1.0 on Raspberry Pi Pico W.

Separated into `Pico` for standard Pico and `PicoW` for Pico with wireless. The Pico W version includes an optional enhanced Wi-Fi connected mode which allows remote access via an API (which you could code an app to access). See documentation in the `PicoW` folder's `README.md`.
